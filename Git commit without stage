Git Commit without Stage
Sometimes, when you make small changes, using the staging environment seems like a waste of time. It is possible to commit changes directly, skipping the staging environment. The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.

Let's add a small update to index.html:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World!</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bluestyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>A new line in our file!</p>

</body>
</html>
And check the status of our repository. But this time, we will use the --short option to see the changes in a more compact way:

Example
git status --short
 M index.html
Note: Short status flags are:

?? - Untracked files
A - Files added to stage
M - Modified files
D - Deleted files
