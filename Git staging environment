#Git Staging Environment
#One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.

#As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment.

#Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. You will learn more about commit shortly.

#For now, we are done working with index.html. So we can add it to the Staging Environment:

#Example
git add index.html
The file should be Staged. Let's check the status::

#Example
git status
On branch master

Changes to be committed:
